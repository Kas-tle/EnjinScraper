> **Enjin is now shutdown so this repository has been archived. I now plan to focusing my efforts on doing things with the data scraped by this tool, such as visualizing and import to other services.

## Usage

> **Warning**
> **If you have 2 factor authentication enabled on your Enjin account, you must either disable it or make a temporary account without 2FA to run this tool!**

To scrape all data the tool can scrape, the account must be a sitewide admin or owner account.

EnjinScraper will now do its best even if you can't provide an API key or a site admin account. At minimum, a regular site account is still needed. There's still of course some limits to this, but I've done my best to include as much as I can. Note there's still a few minor things I have to add to it when it works in this mode, such as it seemingly not getting forum images properly and perhaps a way for it to get application questions. These things are normally handled by the admin panel, but obviously some users trying to archive sites they don't own don't have this luxury. Best of luck to everyone!

To use this mode, you will have to manually provide the module IDs of forums, news, and wiki modules you wish to scrape. This will be the first number found in the URL when on any page of one of these modules. For example, here: `https://www.megacrafting.com/forum/m/4627724/viewthread/9364148-mejinxx-application` the forum module ID is `4627724`. These should be specified as an array of strings under `manualForumModuleIDs`.

> Note: if you've already scraped with a site admin account and api key, this update does not provide any additional data.

### Quick Run With NPX

#### Windows

Run the following in Powershell:

```ps1
mkdir EnjinScraper
cd EnjinScraper
winget install -e --id OpenJS.NodeJS
npx enjinscraper
```

Note that if rerunning later, you may need to use `npx enjinscraper@latest` to force use of the latest version.

### Configuration

#### Obtaining an API key

Per Enjin's instructions:

> To enable your API, visit your admin panel / settings / API area. The content on this page includes your base API URL, your secret API key, and the API mode. Ensure that the API mode is set to "Public".

#### Configuring the `config.json`

Optionally, create a `config.json` file in the root directory of the project. Otherwise, you will be prompted for required values on first run. The file should look like this, but with comments omitted:

```jsonc
{
    "apiKey": "someapiKey", // Required
    "domain": "www.example.com", // Required
    "email": "someemail@email.com", // Required
    "password": "somepassword", // Required
    "adminMode": true,
    "excludeHTMLModuleIDs": [
        "1000001",
        "1000002"
    ],
    "excludeForumModuleIDs": [],
    "excludeNewsModuleIDs": [],
    "excludeTicketModuleIDs": [],
    "excludedWikiModuleIDs": [],
    "manualForumModuleIDs": [],
    "manualNewsModuleIDs": [],
    "manualTicketModuleIDs": [],
    "manualWikiModuleIDs": [],
    "manualUserIDs": [],
    "disabledModules": {
        "html": false,
        "forums": {
            "postIPs": true
        },
        "galleries": false,
        "news": false,
        "wikis": false,
        "tickets": false,
        "applications": false,
        "comments": false,
        "users": {
            "ips": false,
            "tags": false,
            "fullinfo": true,
            "characters": true,
            "games": true,
            "photos": true,
            "wall": true,
            "yourFriends": true
        },
        "files": {
            "s3": false,
            "wiki": false,
            "avatars": true,
            "profileCovers": true,
            "gameBoxes": true,
            "userAlbums": true
        }
    },
    "retrySeconds": 5, // Setting to 0 will retry instantly
    "retryTimes": 5, // Setting to 0 will disable retries; setting to -1 will retry indefinitely
    "debug": true,
    "disableSSL": false,
    "overrideScrapeProgress": false // setting this to true will ignore the scrapers internal progress tracking and scrape all non-disabled modules
}
```

Note that data stemming from user profiles is disabled by default, as this can majorly extend the time needed to scrape sites with large member counts. You can of course change this in `disabledModules.users` You should use an account with the greatest possible permissions, as that will increase the amount of content that can be scraped. Given that, the practical use of this tool is unfortunately limited to those with backend access to the site to be scraped. There is no neeed to enter module IDs, as the scraper will automatically gather info about all modules on the site.

### Running Manually

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kas-tle/EnjinScraper.git
cd EnjinScraper
yarn
npx ts-node index.ts
```

All files scraped will be stored in the `target/files` directory in the same directory as the `config.json` file. The directory structure will simply follow the URL with the `https://` header removed. For example, if the site is `https://www.example.com/somdir/file.png`, the files will be stored in the `target/files/www.example.com/somdir/file.png` directory.

Files that are stored in Enjin's Amazon S3 instance for your site will be automatically downloaded and stored in the `target/files` directory. The files will be stored in the same directory structure as they are on the S3 instance.  All information about these files will be stored in the `s3_files` table in the database. Examples of modules that store files here include galleries, forums, applications, tickets, and news posts.

Files from wiki pages will generally be found under `target/files/s3.amazonaws.com/files.enjin.com/${siteID}/modules/wiki/${wikiPresetID}/file.png`.

User avatars are also scraped, which combines the URLs found in `user_profiles.avatar`, `user_wall_comments.avatar`, and `user_wall_post_likes.avatar`. These will generally be found under `assets-cloud.enjin.com/users/${userID}/avatar/full.${fileID}.png`. Note that these files are generally stored in the database with the size medium, but we download the full size only instead.

Profile cover images come from `user_profiles.cover_image` and are found in either `https://assets-cloud.enjin.com/users/${userID}/cover/${fileID}.png` if the user has uploaded their own cover image, or `resources.enjin.com/${resourceLocator}/themes/${version}/image/profile/cover/${category}/${fileName}.jpg` if the user is using an Enjin provided cover image.

Game boxes are the images displayed for games a user has on their profile. They are found in `assets-cloud.enjin.com/gameboxes/${gameID}/boxmedium.jpg`.

Lastly, user album images from `user_images.url_original` can be found in either `s3.amazonaws.com/assets.enjin.com/users/${userID}/pics/original/${fileName}` or `assets.enjin.com/wall_embed_images/${fileName}`.
